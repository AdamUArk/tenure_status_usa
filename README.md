# tenure_status_usa
use RStudio Project to explore the change in tenure status in the USA over time

https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/

Let's work together and explore the higher education system in the USA.

Each State has a budget and legislation for schools which may be revealed in the faculty status counts.

I am new to git and github and not finding any repositories using R and RStudio projects, decided to start one.

If you like, use RStudio to pull this repository, branch and make changes... Good or Bad or Experimental

Find other data to add, manipulate the data already available, make suggestions, or report ideas

Also let me know if there are better ways to go about a shared project like this.
