https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/

Let's work together and explore the higher education system in the USA.

I am new to git and github and not finding any repositories using R and RStudio projects decided to start one.

If you like, use RStudio to pull this repository and make changes... Good or Bad or Experimental

Find other data to add, manipulate the data already available, make suggestions, or report issues.

Also let me know if there are better ways to go about a shared project like this.
